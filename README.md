🏠 House Price Prediction & Analysis
📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling house price data to understand the key factors that influence property values and to build predictive models for accurate house price estimation.
It combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to deliver meaningful insights and reliable predictions.

The goal is to transform raw housing data into a structured, clean, and informative dataset that can be used for real-world real estate analytics and intelligent pricing systems.
